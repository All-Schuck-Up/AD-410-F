	A group-F production

The idea behind our app was to provide a service/ resource for individuals who
were expieriencing symptoms similar to ones related to covid-19.  We thought of an app that extends
the provider interaction, allowing for real-time patient monoriting for providers and quick response for patients without
the dreaded wait times and added inconvinience.
